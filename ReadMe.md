1. Introduction:

  I implemented the Frequent Pattern Tree association algorithm using Apache Spark. I implemented the whole program in Python. I used the SPARK ML lib’s function
  FPGrowth (pyspark.ml.fpm.FPGrowth) to generate a frequent pattern using the FP tree algorithm.

2. Spark Cluster configurations:

  I created a cluster of 4 machines with 1 master and 3 worker nodes. Each with following configuration

      IP Hostname
      192.168.56.50 SPARK-MASTER

      192.168.56.51 SPARK-WORKER-1

      192.168.56.52 SPARK-WORKER-2

      192.168.56.53 SPARK-WORKER-3

      OS: Linux Centos-7

      RAM: 1 GB, CPU: i5-1038NG7 CPU @ 2.00GHz 1 core

      IP: 192.68.56.101

      Python: 3.6.8
      
3. The item csv file need to be present at all the node at same location. In my case i had copied items.csv as /tmp/FPTree_Using_Spark/data/items.csv location on all the slave nodes.
