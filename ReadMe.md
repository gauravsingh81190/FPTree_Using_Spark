1. Introduction:

  I chose “option 3 implementations of Frequent Pattern Tree association algorithm using Apache Spark. I implemented the whole program in Python.
  I used the SPARK ML lib’s function FPGrowth (pyspark.ml.fpm.FPGrowth) to generate a frequent pattern using the FP tree algorithm.

2. Spark Cluster configurations:

  I created a cluster of 4 machines with 1 master and 3 worker nodes. Each with following configuration

      IP Hostname
      192.168.56.50 SPARK-MASTER

      192.168.56.51 SPARK-WORKER-1

      192.168.56.52 SPARK-WORKER-2

      192.168.56.53 SPARK-WORKER-3

      OS: Linux Centos-7

      RAM: 1 GB, CPU: i5-1038NG7 CPU @ 2.00GHz 1 core

      IP: 192.68.56.101

      Python: 3.6.8
